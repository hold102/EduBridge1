## Lesson 9: Heat & Temperature

### Text Content

**Temperature vs. Heat - What's the Difference?**

Many people confuse these, but they're different!

| Temperature | Heat |
|-------------|------|
| Measures how hot/cold | Energy transferred due to temperature difference |
| Property of an object | Energy in motion |
| Unit: °C, °F, K | Unit: Joules (J) |

**Example:** A cup of tea and a swimming pool can have the same temperature, but the pool contains much more heat energy!

---

**Temperature Scales**

| Scale | Freezing Water | Boiling Water | Absolute Zero |
|-------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| Celsius (°C) | 0°C | 100°C | -273°C |
| Fahrenheit (°F) | 32°F | 212°F | -459°F |
| Kelvin (K) | 273 K | 373 K | 0 K |

**Conversion:** K = °C + 273

**How Does Heat Transfer?**

Heat always flows from hot to cold objects:

1. **Conduction** - Through direct contact
   - Metal spoon in hot soup gets hot
   - Touching a cold window

2. **Convection** - Through fluid movement (liquids/gases)
   - Hot air rises, cool air sinks
   - Boiling water circulating

3. **Radiation** - Through electromagnetic waves (no medium needed)
   - Sun warming Earth
   - Heat from a campfire

---

**Thermal Equilibrium**

When two objects reach the same temperature, heat stops flowing. They're in thermal equilibrium.

**Summary**
Temperature measures hotness; heat is energy transfer. Heat moves by conduction, convection, and radiation - always from hot to cold until equilibrium.

## Lesson 10: Light & Sound (Basic)

### Text Content

**What Is Light?**

Light is a form of energy that travels as waves AND particles. It's the fastest thing in the universe!

**Speed of Light:** 300,000,000 m/s (3 × 10⁸ m/s)

**Key Properties of Light:**
- Travels in straight lines
- Can be reflected (mirrors)
- Can be refracted (bent in water/glass)
- Can be absorbed (dark surfaces)

**The Visible Spectrum**

White light contains all colors: **ROYGBIV**
- **R**ed, **O**range, **Y**ellow, **G**reen, **B**lue, **I**ndigo, **V**iolet

A prism splits white light into its colors. Rainbows form the same way!

---

**What Is Sound?**

Sound is energy that travels as vibrations through a medium (solid, liquid, gas). Unlike light, sound CANNOT travel through a vacuum.

**Speed of Sound:** ~343 m/s in air (much slower than light!)

That's why you see lightning before hearing thunder.

**How Sound Works:**
1. Object vibrates (guitar string, vocal cords)
2. Vibrations create pressure waves in air
3. Waves reach your ear
4. Eardrum vibrates → you hear!

**Properties of Sound:**

| Property | What It Means | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Pitch | How high/low | High: whistle, Low: bass drum |
| Volume | How loud/soft | Controlled by amplitude |
| Speed | How fast it travels | Faster in solids than gases |

**Frequency** determines pitch (Hz = vibrations per second)
- Human hearing: 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz
- Dog whistle: Above human range

---

**Comparing Light & Sound**

| Light | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| Very fast (3×10⁸ m/s) | Slower (343 m/s) |
| Travels through vacuum | Needs a medium |
| Electromagnetic wave | Mechanical wave |
| We see it | We hear it |

**Summary**
Light is fast electromagnetic energy that can travel through space. Sound is slower mechanical vibrations that need a medium. Both are waves with distinct properties.
