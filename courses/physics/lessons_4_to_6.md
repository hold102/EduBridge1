## Lesson 4: Speed & Velocity

### Text Content

**What Is Speed?**

Speed tells us how fast something is moving. It's calculated by:

**Speed = Distance ÷ Time**

Example: If you walk 6 km in 2 hours:
Speed = 6 km ÷ 2 h = 3 km/h

**Units of Speed**
- km/h (kilometers per hour) - used for cars
- m/s (meters per second) - used in physics
- Conversion: 1 m/s = 3.6 km/h

**Average vs. Instantaneous Speed**
- **Average speed**: Total distance ÷ Total time
- **Instantaneous speed**: Speed at a specific moment (what your speedometer shows)

**What Is Velocity?**

Velocity is speed with direction. Two cars can have the same speed but different velocities if they're going different directions.

**Velocity = Displacement ÷ Time**

| Speed | Velocity |
|-------|----------|
| 60 km/h | 60 km/h North |
| No direction | Has direction |
| Always positive | Can be negative |

**Summary**
Speed measures how fast (distance/time). Velocity adds direction (displacement/time). Both use the same units but velocity is more complete.

## Lesson 5: Acceleration

### Text Content

**What Is Acceleration?**

Acceleration is how quickly velocity changes. If you speed up, slow down, or change direction - you're accelerating!

**Acceleration = Change in Velocity ÷ Time**

Or: **a = (v - u) ÷ t**

Where:
- a = acceleration
- v = final velocity
- u = initial velocity
- t = time

**Units of Acceleration**

m/s² (meters per second squared)

This means: "How many m/s does velocity change each second?"

**Positive vs. Negative Acceleration**
- **Positive acceleration**: Speeding up (in direction of motion)
- **Negative acceleration (Deceleration)**: Slowing down

**Example Calculation**

A car speeds up from 0 to 20 m/s in 5 seconds:
- a = (20 - 0) ÷ 5 = 4 m/s²
- The car gains 4 m/s of speed every second

**Real-World Accelerations**
- Falling object (gravity): 9.8 m/s²
- Sports car (0-100 km/h): ~5 m/s²
- Rocket launch: ~30 m/s²

**Summary**
Acceleration measures velocity change over time. Positive means speeding up; negative means slowing down. Unit is m/s².

## Lesson 6: Force

### Text Content

**What Is Force?**

A force is a push or pull that can change an object's motion. Forces can:
- Start motion (pushing a cart)
- Stop motion (brakes on a car)
- Change direction (kicking a ball)
- Change shape (squeezing clay)

**Force Is a Vector**

Force has both magnitude (strength) and direction. 10 N pushing right is different from 10 N pushing left!

**Unit of Force**

Newton (N) - Named after Isaac Newton
- 1 N ≈ the force to hold a small apple
- Your body weight ≈ 500-800 N

**Types of Forces**

| Force | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Gravity | Pulls objects toward Earth | Ball falling |
| Friction | Opposes motion between surfaces | Brakes working |
| Normal | Surface pushing back | Chair supporting you |
| Applied | Direct push or pull | Pushing a door |
| Tension | Force through rope/string | Tug of war |

**Net Force (Resultant Force)**

When multiple forces act:
- Same direction: Add them
- Opposite direction: Subtract them

Example: You push a box with 20 N, friction pushes back 5 N
Net force = 20 - 5 = 15 N forward

**Balanced vs. Unbalanced Forces**
- **Balanced (Net = 0)**: No change in motion
- **Unbalanced (Net ≠ 0)**: Motion changes

**Summary**
Force is a push or pull measured in Newtons. Net force determines if motion changes. Balanced forces mean no acceleration.
