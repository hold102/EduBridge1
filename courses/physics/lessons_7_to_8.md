## Lesson 7: Newton's Laws of Motion

### Text Content

**Isaac Newton's Three Laws**

In 1687, Isaac Newton wrote three simple rules that explain almost all motion. Let's learn them!

---

**First Law: Law of Inertia**

"An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion (at constant velocity) unless acted upon by an unbalanced force."

Simply: Things keep doing what they're doing unless a force changes them.

Examples:
- A book on a table stays there until you move it
- You lurch forward when a car stops suddenly (your body wants to keep moving)
- A hockey puck slides until friction slows it

---

**Second Law: F = ma**

"Force equals mass times acceleration"

**F = m × a**

Where:
- F = Force (Newtons)
- m = Mass (kg)
- a = Acceleration (m/s²)

This means:
- More force → more acceleration
- More mass → less acceleration (harder to move)

Example: Pushing a shopping cart
- Empty cart (small m) → accelerates easily
- Full cart (large m) → harder to accelerate

---

**Third Law: Action-Reaction**

"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."

Forces always come in pairs! When you push something, it pushes back equally.

Examples:
- You push the ground backward, ground pushes you forward (walking)
- Rocket pushes gas down, gas pushes rocket up
- You sit on a chair, chair pushes up on you

**Summary**
1st Law: Objects resist changes in motion (inertia)
2nd Law: F = ma connects force, mass, and acceleration
3rd Law: Forces always come in equal-opposite pairs

- D) 13 N

*Answer: C - F = m × a = 10 × 3 = 30 N*

**Q4.** When you jump, you push the ground downward. What happens according to Newton's Third Law?
- A) Nothing happens
- B) The ground pushes you upward ✓
- C) You push yourself up
- D) Gravity increases

*Answer: B - Third Law: equal and opposite reaction - ground pushes you up.*

**Q5.** Why does a heavy truck need more force than a car to accelerate at the same rate?
- A) Trucks have more wheels
- B) Trucks have more mass ✓
- C) Cars are faster
- D) F = ma doesn't apply to trucks

*Answer: B - More mass requires more force for the same acceleration (F = ma).*

**Q6.** A hockey puck slides across ice and eventually stops. This is explained by:
- A) The puck runs out of force
- B) Friction acts as an unbalanced force ✓
- C) It violates Newton's First Law
- D) Gravity pulls it down

*Answer: B - Friction is an external force that slows the puck.*

**Q7.** You push a wall with 100 N. The wall pushes back with:
- A) 0 N
- B) 50 N
- C) 100 N ✓
- D) More than 100 N

*Answer: C - Third Law: action = reaction, so wall pushes back with equal force.*

## Lesson 8: Work, Energy & Power

### Text Content

**What Is Work? (In Physics)**

In physics, "work" has a specific meaning: Work is done when a force moves an object.

**Work = Force × Distance**
**W = F × d**

Where:
- W = Work (Joules, J)
- F = Force (N)
- d = Distance moved in force direction (m)

**Important:** If nothing moves, no work is done!
- Holding a heavy box → No work (no movement)
- Pushing a box across a room → Work done!

---

**What Is Energy?**

Energy is the ability to do work. It comes in many forms:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Kinetic | Energy of motion | Moving car |
| Potential | Stored energy (position) | Ball on a shelf |
| Heat | Thermal energy | Hot stove |
| Chemical | Stored in bonds | Food, batteries |
| Electrical | Moving electrons | Lightning |

**Kinetic Energy:** KE = ½ × m × v²

**Gravitational Potential Energy:** PE = m × g × h

Where g = 9.8 m/s² (gravity) and h = height

---

**Conservation of Energy**

Energy cannot be created or destroyed - only transformed.

Example - Roller coaster:
- Top of hill: Maximum potential energy
- Bottom of hill: Maximum kinetic energy
- PE converts to KE as you fall!

---

**What Is Power?**

Power is how fast work is done (rate of energy transfer).

**Power = Work ÷ Time**
**P = W / t**

Unit: Watt (W)
- 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second
- 1 kilowatt (kW) = 1,000 Watts
- Light bulb: 60 W
- Car engine: ~100,000 W

**Summary**
Work = Force × Distance. Energy is the ability to do work (kinetic + potential). Power is work done per unit time. Energy is conserved.
