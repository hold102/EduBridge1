## Lesson 1: What Is Physics?

### Text Content

**Welcome to Physics!**

Physics is the science that studies how the world around us works. It explains why things fall, how cars move, why the sky is blue, and even how your phone works!

**What Does Physics Study?**
- **Matter**: Anything that takes up space (like you, water, or air)
- **Energy**: The ability to do work (like heat, light, or electricity)
- **Motion**: How things move from one place to another
- **Forces**: Pushes and pulls that make things speed up, slow down, or change direction

**Real-World Examples**
- When you kick a football, physics explains why it curves
- When you plug in a charger, physics explains how electricity flows
- When ice melts in your drink, physics explains the heat transfer

**Why Study Physics?**
Understanding physics helps us build bridges, design phones, create medicines, and explore space. It's the foundation of all engineering and technology!

**Summary**
Physics is the study of matter, energy, and their interactions. It helps us understand everything from the smallest atoms to the largest galaxies.

## Lesson 2: Measurement & Units

### Text Content

**Why Do We Measure?**

Imagine telling a friend to meet you "far away" - how would they know where to go? Measurement gives us exact numbers so we can communicate clearly and do experiments accurately.

**The SI System (International System of Units)**

Scientists worldwide use the same units so everyone understands each other:

| Quantity | SI Unit | Symbol | Example |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| Length | Meter | m | A door is about 2 m tall |
| Mass | Kilogram | kg | A textbook is about 1 kg |
| Time | Second | s | A heartbeat takes about 1 s |
| Temperature | Kelvin | K | Room temperature ≈ 300 K |

**Prefixes Make Numbers Easier**
- **Kilo (k)** = 1,000 → 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters
- **Centi (c)** = 0.01 → 1 centimeter = 0.01 meters
- **Milli (m)** = 0.001 → 1 millimeter = 0.001 meters

**Measuring Tools**
- **Ruler**: Measures length
- **Scale/Balance**: Measures mass
- **Stopwatch**: Measures time
- **Thermometer**: Measures temperature

**Summary**
Measurement uses standardized units (SI system) to describe the physical world precisely. The basic units are meter, kilogram, second, and Kelvin.

## Lesson 3: Motion & Rest

### Text Content

**What Is Motion?**

Motion means an object is changing its position over time. If something stays in the same place, it's at rest.

**Motion Is Relative**

Here's a mind-bender: motion depends on what you're comparing to!
- Sitting on a bus: You're at rest relative to the bus, but moving relative to the road
- Standing on Earth: You're at rest relative to Earth, but Earth is moving around the Sun!

**Reference Point (Frame of Reference)**

To describe motion, you need a reference point - something you consider "not moving."
- Example: A tree by the road is a good reference point to see if a car is moving

**Types of Motion**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Linear | Straight line | Car on a highway |
| Circular | Around a center | Ferris wheel |
| Oscillatory | Back and forth | Swing |
| Random | No pattern | Dust particles in air |

**Distance vs. Displacement**
- **Distance**: Total path traveled (always positive)
- **Displacement**: Shortest path from start to end (can be zero!)

Example: Walking around a track and returning to start:
- Distance = 400 m (full lap)
- Displacement = 0 m (you're back where you started)

**Summary**
Motion is change in position relative to a reference point. Distance is total path; displacement is shortest path from start to finish.

**Q2.** You're sitting in a moving train. Relative to the train, you are:
- A) In motion
- B) At rest ✓
- C) Accelerating
- D) Falling

*Answer: B - You're not changing position relative to the train, so you're at rest.*

**Q3.** A child runs around a circular track and returns to the starting point. What is their displacement?
- A) Equal to the circumference
- B) Half the circumference
- C) Zero ✓
- D) Cannot be determined

- C) Oscillatory ✓
- D) Random

*Answer: C - A swing moves back and forth repeatedly, which is oscillatory motion.*

- A) To make physics harder
- B) Because motion is relative and needs comparison ✓
- C) Reference points create motion
- D) It's not actually necessary

*Answer: B - Motion can only be described in comparison to something else.*
